### ðŸ©· About me ðŸ©·
Hey there! Iâ€™m Kirsten from the Philippines, born in 1998. My interests span a wide range of activities, but some of my favorites include coding, playing games, watching movies and series, and listening to music.

I only play this game only when I'm really in the mood to loot and then d1e right after landing.

<summary>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</summary>
I open this game almost everyday. I don't know why. When I'm feeling bored, I open their app and then close it right away.
